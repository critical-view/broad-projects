Still struggling with the finer details of setting up dependencies on my mac -_-

Using GitHub Desktop comfortably now. Much easier than I thought. Have started learning python and sphinx for documentation. Looking at WingPersonal and Textmate at the moment. I am still more comfortable with bbEdit as I have been setting it up to help with the typing to offset the RA.
